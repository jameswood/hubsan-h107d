# hubsan-h107d

These Adobe Media Encoder presets will fix the video from a Hubsan H107D quadcopter.

The video from a Hubsan H107D is recorded at an exotic 720x240. These presets crop the noise from the right-hand-side and scale the height up to 480 to correct the vertical compression that the Hubsan uses because of reasons. The output is in H264.

Hubsan Low is a low-bitrate, 30fps output for small filesizes.

Hubsan High is a high-bitrate, 60fps output for higher quality.
